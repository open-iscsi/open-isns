When hacking on open-isns, or when trying to locate a problem,
the following information may be useful:

 -	You can start the daemon using the -f option, which
 	prevents it from backgrounding itself. Crucial if
	you want to run it in a debugger, or under strace.

	This option works for isnsd and isnsdd

 -	All tools support the "-d" option to enable debugging.
 	In general, you want to use "-d all" to turn on all
	debugging options. However, you can select individual
	debug facilities - check out the manpages and/or
	the source code in logging.c

 -	If you want to debug memory issues (crashing, memory leaks, etc),
 	there is a memory debuging module (mdebug.c), but it doesn't
	currently work. So you're on your own. If you figure out
	something useful, or you get the current mdebug.c file working,
	please update this file.
